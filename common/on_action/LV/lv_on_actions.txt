# Inconsequential vassal generator and title distributor
# - Will generate vassals for characters that exist in history that hold all titles in their respective duchies
# - Add entries here for duchies you don't really want to create an entire dedicated history for (mainly county-level vassals)
# - Parameters:
# - > GRANT_DUCHY - Whether to grant the holder of the county the duchy title on game start (you can either use this or just give them the duchy via history)
# - > DUCHY - The corresponding duchy title
# - > GIVE_COUNTY_CAPITAL - Whether to give away the capital county (or special cases such as Selhoru) to generated vassals as well
# - > COUNTY_OF_HOLDER - The "capital county" in reference
# - > GRANT_INDEPENDENCE - Whether to make the generated vassals break away on game start
# - > INHERIT_LIEGE_GOVERNMENT - Whether the new vassal inherits the liege's government type
# - > GOVERNMENT - Government to adopt if set to not inherit liege's government. If set to inherit, serves as the fallback government
# - > VASSAL_CULTURE - Culture of the new vassal
# - > VASSAL_FAITH - Faith of the new vassal
# - > VASSAL_FEMALE_CHANCE - How likely is the new vassal to be female
