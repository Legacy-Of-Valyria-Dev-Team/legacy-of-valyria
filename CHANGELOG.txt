VERSION 0.4.5
- Added localisation for various colonisation and settlement events
- Altered colonisation skill check events
- Added Shadow Magic Spells. 
- Increased Fire Magic, Water Magic, and Air Magic Spells to a minimum of four spells per category. 
- Revised the Blood Magic Healing effect. It should now properly scale in potency and efficiency with the Blood Magic XP track. Now you will need to use multiple casts of the spell to cure deeply damaged characters. 


Version 0.6.2 
Refactored Magic Effects to be consistent in naming schmatics to make future expansion easier. 
Completed the Localisation for all spells. 
Refactored the entire magic system to better enable readability.
Fixed a whole lot of context switch errors, where there was no proper check for a scope existing prior to checking the scope. 
Fixed a typo in the learn magic event, adding a non-existent trait zz_nagister rather than zz_magister. I apologise to all your wives for mistaking them for you, my blood magic wielding degenerates!
