Unfathomably old and cloaked in eternal darkness, the city stands as a monument to a forgotten era. Not even the most daring shadowbinders dare to venture into its forsaken streets. The towering spires and labyrinthine alleys are said to be traveled by demons and creatures alike. Veiled in secrecy, its true origins and the extent of its dark powers remain unknown."
