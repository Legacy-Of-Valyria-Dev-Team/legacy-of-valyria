building_stygai_01_desc:0 "Stygai, the enigmatic and ancient city shrouded in the dark heart of the Shadow Lands, 
remains one of the most fear inducing mysteries of the world. Unfathomably old and cloaked in eternal darkness, the city stands as a monument to a forgotten, mysterious era. 
Not even the most daring shadowbinders dare to venture into its forsaken streets. The towering spires and labyrinthine alleys echo with the whispers of the long-dead, 
their tortured spirits forever bound to the cursed ground. Veiled in secrecy, its true origins and the extent of its dark powers remain unknown."
