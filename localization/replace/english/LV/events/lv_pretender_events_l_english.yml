  lv_pretender_empire.1.desc:0 "Since the Doom of Valyria, Essos has been without a guiding hand. To the north, Dothraki savages lay waste to all beneath their steeds, and to the east the scions of the harpy grow bolder in embracing their Ghiscari heritage, and the daughter-colonies of the Freehold have been left to their own devices as the Free Cities of Essos.\n\nYou ponder your options going forward. Many have dreamed of reviving the legacy of the Freehold, and even fewer have dared to attempt. The Free Cities—having resisted attempts at subjugation numerous times prior—are themselves still proud of their Valyrian heritage, with each in some form asserting themselves as the true heirs to Valyria. To establish yourself as its successor state would no doubt signal to them your intentions of dominion over the Freehold's former lands."
