 agot_tradition_volantene_name:0 "First Daughter of the Freehold"
 agot_tradition_volantene_desc:0 "Settled as the first colony of the Valyrian Freehold, the people of Volantis hold their Valyrian ancestry in the highest regard. Though not directly descended from the dragonlords of old, the Volantene aristocracy proudly claim to be their rightful heirs, embodying the sophistication, pride, and arrogance of their claimed ancestors. The rulers of Volantis present themselves as refined and cultured, but beneath this veil of nobility lies a deeply entrenched system of slavery. A system where lives are controlled with ruthless efficiency, fueling the city's wealth and status. For the Volantene elite, glory and order come first —even if it requires human suffering to achieve it."

 agot_tradition_braavosi_name:0 "No Man a Slave"
 agot_tradition_braavosi_desc:0 "Founded by slaves who escaped the Valyrian Freehold, the Braavosi stand as a bastion of freedom and cultural diversity. From its inception, the Braavosi welcomed people of all backgrounds, religions, and races. This inclusivity is exemplified by their unwavering opposition to slavery, a stance that sharply contrasts with most other Free Cities. The fluid, graceful fighting style that combines precision and agility embodies the adaptability and resilience of Braavosi culture. To be a citizen of Braavos, is to be free and fight for that freedom."

 agot_tradition_meereenese_name:0 "Masters of Old"
 agot_tradition_meereenese_desc:0 "Meereenese culture is steeped in tradition, rigid hierarchy, and an unwavering pride in heritage. The Great Masters, Meereenese ruling aristocrats, maintain their status through elaborate ceremonies and displays of wealth seen in their extravagant pyramids. Central to this culture is slavery, viewed not only as economic necessity but as a symbol of social order and privilege, woven into public festivals, customs, and daily life."

 agot_tradition_yunkish_name:0 "The Wise Masters"
 agot_tradition_yunkish_desc:0 "The Yunkai’i place the highest value on wealth and indulgence, viewing luxury as the ultimate measure of success. The ruling class, known for their cunning and political knowhow, navigate a landscape filled with extravagance. However, a culture built entirely on the selling of fellow men inevitably breeds corruption."

 agot_tradition_astapori_name:0 "Discipline and Dehumanisation"
 agot_tradition_astapori_desc:0 "The Astapori are closely tied to the Unsullied, the elite eunuch warriors trained under harsh conditions to serve their masters with unwavering loyalty. The Good Master’s, Astapori ruling class, pride themselves on producing the most formidable soldiers, viewing their brutal training methods as symbols of honour and prestige."

 agot_tradition_ghiscari_name:0 "Scorn of Valyria"
 agot_tradition_ghiscari_desc:0 "The Ghiscari people are rooted in ancient traditions and a rich historical legacy that dates back to the height of the Ghiscar Empire. Known for their sophisticated architecture and artistic achievements, the Ghiscari take great pride in their monumental structures and elaborate sculptures that reflect their appreciation for beauty and craftsmanship. The scars of the Valyrian Conquest still linger, fostering a deep-seated dislike that shapes their view of Valyrian customs and the lingering influence of their ancient rivals."
