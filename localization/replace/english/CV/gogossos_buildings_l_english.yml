building_the_red_citadel_1_desc:0 "A large coastal tower, believed to be the last remnant of a once-mighty fortress, now serves as the city's primary stronghold. Though much of the original structure has been lost to time, this lone bastion endures—small yet incredibly sturdy and highly defensible. Thick walls of weathered stone stand firm against both the elements and potential sieges, making it a reliable seat of authority within Gogossos. While not yet a grand citadel, it remains a formidable keep, a foundation upon which greater fortifications may one day rise"

building_the_red_citadel_3_desc:0 "Once a mere remnant of the past, the Red Citadel has been rebuilt into a vast and unyielding fortress, towering over Gogossos as the city's ultimate seat of power. No longer just a lone tower, it now stands as a fully restored keep and stronghold, its colossal Valyrian Blackstone walls stretching high and thick, a monument to dominance and dread. \n Like the Crimson Gate, the walls of the Red Citadel were once infused with blood magic rituals performed by the Ancient Valyrians, their sorcery forever staining the stone a deep, unnatural crimson. Though the rituals have long since faded into history, their dark legacy endures, making the citadel not only a near-impenetrable stronghold, but also a haunting symbol of absolute power. \n At its heart, The Red Tower pierces the sky, its presence casting a long shadow over the city, a constant reminder of the Archon's authority. The lower walls and courtyard remain slick with blood, not only from the rituals of the past but from the countless executions, betrayals, and brutal conflicts that have played out upon its stones. The blood of rebels, conspirators, and enemies of the state has seeped into its foundations, ensuring that fear is woven into the very fabric of the fortress. \n It is whispered that within these walls, the Red Plague first took root, a curse that once ravaged Gogossos, leaving entire districts drowning in blood and suffering. Though the disease has long faded into history, some say the citadel still remembers, that the ghosts of the dying linger in its deepest chambers, whispering to those who listen. \n A place of iron rule and legend, the Red Citadel is more than just a fortress—it is the unyielding core of Gogossos, a place where power is absolute, mercy is scarce, and rebellion is crushed before it can begin."

The very stones are steeped in history—stained deep crimson from the ancient Valyrian blood rituals once performed here, leaving a permanent, eerie mark of the dark arts that fortified its defenses. The gatehouse, a colossal bastion standing 140 feet high, looms like a titan over all who approach, its mere presence instilling awe and dread. Perched atop its mighty walls, a row of dragon statues stands in silent vigil, their massive gemstone eyes glinting with an unnatural luster—watching, waiting, as if the souls of the beasts they depict still linger within the stone.\n Few have ever dared to breach the Crimson Gate, and fewer still have lived to tell the tale. It is not merely a barrier—it is a monument to the unyielding might of Gogossos, an enduring testament to the city's forgotten power and the dark legacy of Valyria itself. "

Flawless sapphires, deep as the ocean, lie waiting in thick clusters, while diamonds of staggering size remain embedded in the hardest rock, requiring skill and precision to extract. Entire teams of miners work around the clock, their tools echoing through the vast underground halls as they carve wealth from the earth itself. \n But with depth comes danger. The tunnels stretch into darkness deeper than any map accounts for, and in the lowest chambers, where the air is thick and heavy, there are places the miners refuse to go. Some claim they have unearthed more than gems in the depths—things buried long before men first picked up their tools. There are whispers of shadows moving where no light should be, of distant, rhythmic tremors that do not come from cave-ins, and of a deep, lingering heat that should not exist this far below. \n Despite the risks, The Starlit Depths is the crown jewel of the Gogossosi mines, a place where fortunes are made and lives are lost in equal measure. Only the most skilled and determined miners dare to work here—knowing that within these walls lie some of the most valuable gems ever unearthed, but also the danger of digging too deep… and waking something best left undisturbed."
