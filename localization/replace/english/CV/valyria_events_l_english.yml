 valyria.0002.desc:0 "After weeks of battling relentless storms and treacherous seas, your ship finally approaches the desolate shores of Nuqiria. The once-mighty vessel now bears the scars of your arduous journey, its sails tattered and hull battered. As you step onto the crumbling, ancient docks, a sense of relief washes over you, mingled with the lingering tension of the trials you’ve faced. The air is thick with the scent of salt and decay, and the distant cries of seabirds echo eerily through the ruins. Nuqiria, once a beacon of civilization, now stands in silent desolation. Towering spires lie in ruins, and the once-bustling markets are now overgrown with wild vegetation. The journey has left its mark on you and your crew. Faces are drawn, eyes wary, but there’s a glimmer of determination in every gaze."

Just a little more—then the ledge beneath my foot gave way. For a single, gut-wrenching moment, I was weightless, my arms grasping at empty air.

gogossos_expedition.1002:0 "As I crest the rugged cliffside, I shake off the dust and debris clinging to me, exhaling as the world unfolds beneath my gaze. The land stretches far and wide, a breathtaking tapestry of jagged rock, dense jungle, and rolling hills bathed in the golden glow of the dying sun. Mist rises from the canopy below, swirling like ghostly tendrils between the ancient trees, their emerald leaves glistening with the remnants of the day’s heat. But beyond the jungle, beyond the wild, untamed beauty, my eyes lock onto something truly magnificent—a palace of pure white stone, standing regal and defiant atop a distant hill. Its towering spires pierce the sky, catching the last light of day, gleaming like the citadel of forgotten gods.\n A thrill surges through me, an undeniable pull, as if fate itself is calling. That must be where the treasure lies—sealed within walls of marble, veiled in the echoes of lost empires. But time is against me. The jungle below will be treacherous by night, its shadows hiding creatures unknown, its depths alive with whispers of danger."

gogossos_expedition.1002.z:0 "We Make for the Palace, Now!!!"
gogossos_expedition.1003:0 "As I step through the grand entrance of the palace, a strange contrast unfolds before me. From the outside, its gleaming white walls and towering spires stand untouched by time, regal and unyielding. But within, decay has taken hold. The once-majestic halls are crumbling, their gilded arches cracked and weathered. Dust chokes the air, and the scent of rot lingers in the stagnant silence. Broken furniture, long since reduced to ruin, lies scattered across the stone floors, its once-rich fabrics reduced to nothing but tattered remnants of the past. \n I search, pressing deeper into the abandoned corridors, but I find nothing—no treasure, no sign of life, only echoes of a forgotten age. It feels as if the palace itself is a husk, an empty shell of grandeur that time has long since forsaken. Yet, just as doubt begins to creep in, I come upon a staircase, winding downward into shadow. \n Drawn forward, I descend into the basement, where the last rays of sunlight filter through intricate crystal mirrors, casting shimmering beams of gold and violet across the chamber. The light catches on something breathtaking—ancient Valyrian artworks, etched into the stone above the great door before me. The images tell a story of power and fire, of mighty Dragonlords reigning over the skies, their great beasts coiling through clouds of flame. Their eyes, carved from precious gemstones, glint in the fractured light, as if watching me, judging me.\n I linger, captivated by the artistry, by the sheer weight of history pressing down upon this place. But then a chilling realization settles over me—throughout this entire palace, I have seen no sign of the dead. No skeletons. No remains of those who once called this place home.\n A place abandoned by time… yet seemingly untouched by death.\nA shiver runs down my spine as I step closer to the great door, my hand hovering over its cold surface. Something is wrong here. And I am about to find out what."

palace.1:0 "The only way forward is down...."
gogossos_expedition.1004:0 "As I descend deeper into the bowels of the palace, the spiraling staircase seems endless, the air growing colder with each step. Shadows twist and writhe along the ancient stone walls, yet I press on, driven by equal parts curiosity and unease. Finally, I reach the bottom—a vast chamber, impossibly illuminated despite the depths. The light, soft and golden, spills from unseen sources, casting an otherworldly glow upon the walls. \n My breath catches as I take in the sight before me another magnificent mural, its artistry unmatched, radiating a sense of awe and reverence. This one depicts dragons in their full, majestic glory, each unique, each breathtaking in its splendor. \n The Mighty Purple Dragon, its scales shimmering like amethyst, unleashes a torrent of fire, its power unmatched. \n The White Dragon, swift and fierce, seems almost to blur in motion, its slender frame cutting through clouds like a blade.\n The Red Dragon, its eyes burning with malice, looms as a tyrant, its presence commanding fear and dread. \n And finally, the Black Dragon—mysterious, mythical, its form shrouded in an aura of dark majesty, as though it exists between this world and the next. \n I have but a moment to marvel at the mural’s beauty, my fingers tracing the edge of the intricate carvings. Then, the sound comes. A low, familiar groan of ancient stone shifting. My heart seizes in my chest, and a chill races down my spine as the noise grows louder, more violent. I whip around, eyes wide with alarm, just as the floor beneath me gives way.\n The world tilts, and I’m weightless, my scream catching in my throat as the stone crumbles into darkness. My mind barely has time to register the terror before I’m plunging into the unknown below, the faint glow of the mural vanishing as I fall."

Purple, White, Red, Black—no matter how long I stare, no matter how much I search for answers in their intricate designs, they remain an enigma. There’s no escape, no exit from this wretched place. Just the cold, unyielding stone, the eerie glow of the crystals, and the oppressive silence that seems to stretch into eternity. \n I’m doomed to waste away here, trapped in this endless nightmare, with nothing but these cursed doors and my own growing despair for company. My strength is already failing me, my body weakening with every passing moment. I can feel the emptiness creeping in, my mind clawing at the edges of sanity. \n But I won’t let it end like this. I refuse to wither into a husk, to become a shadow of myself, forgotten and consumed by this place. If this is to be my end, it will be on my terms, by my own hand. I will not let dishonor take me, nor the slow, cruel grip of starvation. \n I glance at the doors one last time, their silent presence mocking me, and steel myself for what must be done. Better to face the unknown than to let this cursed palace strip me of all that I am. Better to go with defiance in my heart than to let the darkness claim me piece by piece."
