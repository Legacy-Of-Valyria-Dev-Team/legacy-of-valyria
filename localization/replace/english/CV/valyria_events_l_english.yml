 valyria.0002.desc:0 "After weeks of battling relentless storms and treacherous seas, your ship finally approaches the desolate shores of Nuqiria. The once-mighty vessel now bears the scars of your arduous journey, its sails tattered and hull battered. As you step onto the crumbling, ancient docks, a sense of relief washes over you, mingled with the lingering tension of the trials you’ve faced. The air is thick with the scent of salt and decay, and the distant cries of seabirds echo eerily through the ruins. Nuqiria, once a beacon of civilization, now stands in silent desolation. Towering spires lie in ruins, and the once-bustling markets are now overgrown with wild vegetation. The journey has left its mark on you and your crew. Faces are drawn, eyes wary, but there’s a glimmer of determination in every gaze."
