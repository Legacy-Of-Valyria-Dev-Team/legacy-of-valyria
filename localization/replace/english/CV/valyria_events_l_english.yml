 valyria.0002.desc:0 "After weeks of battling relentless storms and treacherous seas, your ship finally approaches the desolate shores of Nuqiria. The once-mighty vessel now bears the scars of your arduous journey, its sails tattered and hull battered. As you step onto the crumbling, ancient docks, a sense of relief washes over you, mingled with the lingering tension of the trials you've faced. The air is thick with the scent of salt and decay, and the distant cries of seabirds echo eerily through the ruins. Nuqiria, once a beacon of civilization, now stands in silent desolation. Towering spires lie in ruins, and the once-bustling markets are now overgrown with wild vegetation. The journey has left its mark on you and your crew. Faces are drawn, eyes wary, but there's a glimmer of determination in every gaze."

The land stretches far and wide, a breathtaking tapestry of jagged rock, dense jungle, and rolling hills bathed in the golden glow of the dying sun. Mist rises from the canopy below, swirling like ghostly tendrils between the ancient trees, their emerald leaves glistening with the remnants of the day's heat. But beyond the jungle, beyond the wild, untamed beauty, my eyes lock onto something truly magnificent—a palace of pure white stone, standing regal and defiant atop a distant hill. Its towering spires pierce the sky, catching the last light of day, gleaming like the citadel of forgotten gods.\n A thrill surges through me, an undeniable pull, as if fate itself is calling. That must be where the treasure lies—sealed within walls of marble, veiled in the echoes of lost empires. But time is against me. The jungle below will be treacherous by night, its shadows hiding creatures unknown, its depths alive with whispers of danger."

gogossos_expedition.1002.z:0 "We Make for the Palace, Now!!!"
gogossos_expedition.1003:0 "As I step through the grand entrance of the palace, a strange contrast unfolds before me. From the outside, its gleaming white walls and towering spires stand untouched by time, regal and unyielding. But within, decay has taken hold. The once-majestic halls are crumbling, their gilded arches cracked and weathered. Dust chokes the air, and the scent of rot lingers in the stagnant silence. Broken furniture, long since reduced to ruin, lies scattered across the stone floors, its once-rich fabrics reduced to nothing but tattered remnants of the past. \n I search, pressing deeper into the abandoned corridors, but I find nothing—no treasure, no sign of life, only echoes of a forgotten age. It feels as if the palace itself is a husk, an empty shell of grandeur that time has long since forsaken. Yet, just as doubt begins to creep in, I come upon a staircase, winding downward into shadow. \n Drawn forward, I descend into the basement, where the last rays of sunlight filter through intricate crystal mirrors, casting shimmering beams of gold and violet across the chamber. The light catches on something breathtaking—ancient Valyrian artworks, etched into the stone above the great door before me. The images tell a story of power and fire, of mighty Dragonlords reigning over the skies, their great beasts coiling through clouds of flame. Their eyes, carved from precious gemstones, glint in the fractured light, as if watching me, judging me.\n I linger, captivated by the artistry, by the sheer weight of history pressing down upon this place. But then a chilling realization settles over me—throughout this entire palace, I have seen no sign of the dead. No skeletons. No remains of those who once called this place home.\n A place abandoned by time… yet seemingly untouched by death.\nA shiver runs down my spine as I step closer to the great door, my hand hovering over its cold surface. Something is wrong here. And I am about to find out what."

palace.1:0 "The only way forward is down...."
gogossos_expedition.1004:0 "As I descend deeper into the bowels of the palace, the spiraling staircase seems endless, the air growing colder with each step. Shadows twist and writhe along the ancient stone walls, yet I press on, driven by equal parts curiosity and unease. Finally, I reach the bottom—a vast chamber, impossibly illuminated despite the depths. The light, soft and golden, spills from unseen sources, casting an otherworldly glow upon the walls. \n My breath catches as I take in the sight before me another magnificent mural, its artistry unmatched, radiating a sense of awe and reverence. This one depicts dragons in their full, majestic glory, each unique, each breathtaking in its splendor. \n The Mighty Purple Dragon, its scales shimmering like amethyst, unleashes a torrent of fire, its power unmatched. \n The White Dragon, swift and fierce, seems almost to blur in motion, its slender frame cutting through clouds like a blade.\n The Red Dragon, its eyes burning with malice, looms as a tyrant, its presence commanding fear and dread. \n And finally, the Black Dragon—mysterious, mythical, its form shrouded in an aura of dark majesty, as though it exists between this world and the next. \n I have but a moment to marvel at the mural's beauty, my fingers tracing the edge of the intricate carvings. Then, the sound comes. A low, familiar groan of ancient stone shifting. My heart seizes in my chest, and a chill races down my spine as the noise grows louder, more violent. I whip around, eyes wide with alarm, just as the floor beneath me gives way.\n The world tilts, and I'm weightless, my scream catching in my throat as the stone crumbles into darkness. My mind barely has time to register the terror before I'm plunging into the unknown below, the faint glow of the mural vanishing as I fall."

Just the cold, unyielding stone, the eerie glow of the crystals, and the oppressive silence that seems to stretch into eternity. \n I'm doomed to waste away here, trapped in this endless nightmare, with nothing but these cursed doors and my own growing despair for company. My strength is already failing me, my body weakening with every passing moment. I can feel the emptiness creeping in, my mind clawing at the edges of sanity. \n But I won't let it end like this. I refuse to wither into a husk, to become a shadow of myself, forgotten and consumed by this place. If this is to be my end, it will be on my terms, by my own hand. I will not let dishonor take me, nor the slow, cruel grip of starvation. \n I glance at the doors one last time, their silent presence mocking me, and steel myself for what must be done. Better to face the unknown than to let this cursed palace strip me of all that I am. Better to go with defiance in my heart than to let the darkness claim me piece by piece."

Each door is massive and carved with intricate designs, their details illuminated by the shimmering light of the crystals above. My heart pounds as I take a step closer, drawn to their ominous presence. \n The doors are unlike anything I've seen before, each one radiating its own distinct aura, as though imbued with power. \n The Purple Door gleams like polished amethyst, its surface alive with carvings of flames and twisting serpentine dragons. The fire they breathe seems almost to move when the light hits it just right, and the air around it hums with an unearthly energy. \n The White Door, in stark contrast, is sleek and smooth, like polished ivory. Its carvings depict a dragon in flight, its form slender and graceful, wings spread wide as if caught in eternal motion. The cold light of the crystals gives it an almost spectral glow, as though it's untouched by time. \n The Red Door is bold and terrifying. Its surface is etched with jagged, chaotic patterns, the lines deep and rough, as though scorched into the wood by fire itself. A monstrous dragon with cruel, sharp eyes is carved into its frame, its presence radiating menace. Even standing near it makes the air feel heavy and oppressive. \n The Black Door is the most enigmatic. It seems to absorb the light, its surface smooth and dark as obsidian. Shadows seem to dance across it, shifting and twisting like they have a life of their own. The carvings here are subtle and difficult to make out, but the dragon depicted feels otherworldly, almost incomprehensible—more spirit than beast. \n Each door pulses faintly with an unseen force, as though beckoning me forward. Yet there's no indication of what lies behind them. My eyes flicker between them, my mind racing. Is this the end of the palace? Or is it the beginning of something far worse? \n My instincts scream at me to choose carefully, but no matter what, I know there's no turning back now. One of these doors holds my path forward—or my doom."

My breath is ragged, my heart pounding in my chest as I take a moment to steady myself. The air here feels heavier, colder, like it's pressing down on me, and the faint glow of the crystal lights still lingers, guiding me forward. \n Before me stretches a long corridor, impossibly long, its end swallowed by shadows. The walls are carved from the same ancient stone as the rest of the palace, but here they're lined with faintly glowing runes—patterns of forgotten language that pulse softly as if alive. The corridor seems alive with an eerie energy, a strange vibration that I can feel in my bones. \n The floor beneath me is damp, slick with condensation, and every step I take sends an echo down the corridor that bounces back to me like a whisper. It feels like the place is watching, listening, waiting. \n There's something unsettling about this hallway—something that makes the hair on the back of my neck stand on end. The air grows colder with each step, and a strange, low hum begins to fill the silence. It's distant at first, but the further I walk, the louder it becomes, like the sound of a distant heartbeat, deep and resonant. \n The corridor seems endless, the shadows ahead refusing to yield to the light. Every instinct tells me to turn back, to find another way, but I know there's no going back now. Whatever lies at the end of this corridor, I must face it.

Glass vials, some cracked and others still intact, clutter the tables, filled with liquids that glimmer faintly under the pale light of the crystals above. Strange devices, their purpose unfathomable, sit alongside them, their brass and silver frames tarnished yet oddly intricate. \n But it's the table at the back of the room that draws my attention. There, slumped over its surface, is a skeleton draped in a tattered hooded robe. The bones are yellowed with age, yet there's something strangely deliberate about its positioning. It's as though the mage—if that's what he was—knew the end was coming and chose this place as his final resting spot. \n In front of the skeleton, scattered across the table, lies a collection of items. A dusty, leather-bound journal, its cover cracked but intact, sits at the center. The air around it feels heavy, as though it holds secrets meant to stay buried. Beside the journal, gleaming even in the faint light, are several gold bars, their edges worn but unmistakable in their value. \n I step closer, my breath shallow as I take it all in. The journal seems to almost call to me, its presence commanding my attention far more than the gold ever could. My fingers hover over its cover, hesitating. This room feels like it holds answers—or perhaps more questions. \n Who was this mage? What happened to him? And why does it feel like I've stumbled upon something that was never meant to be found?"

My fingers trace the cracked leather cover as I flip through its fragile pages, the ink faded but still legible. I quickly scan the last entry, drawn to the final thoughts of the long-dead mage. \n The words chill me to my core. He wrote of his final hours, of how the Gogossosi Blood Plague had taken hold of his body, ravaging him from within. His descriptions are vivid and haunting—of the fever, the bleeding, and the weakness that consumed him, robbing him of the strength to continue his work. He lamented his unfinished experiments, his wasted potential, and the legacy he would never leave behind. His despair seeps from the page, each word a painful reminder of how cruel and final his end must have been. \n But before I could delve further, the room began to tremble. A low rumble, like the growl of an awakening beast, vibrates through the stone walls. Dust falls in thick clouds from above, and the faint light of the crystals begins to flicker wildly. I glance up as small rocks start to fall, followed by the groaning cracks of the ceiling shifting under unseen pressure. The room is collapsing. \n Panic floods my veins. I shove the journal back onto the table—it's too heavy, too fragile to carry—and instead snatch up the gleaming gold bars. My instincts scream at me to run, to escape before I'm buried alive alongside the mage's remains. \n I bolt for the door—or what's left of it—but just as I reach the threshold, the runic script carved into the floor flares to life. The glowing symbols pulse with blinding intensity, filling the room with an otherworldly radiance. The sound of the collapsing room is drowned out by a sharp, almost deafening hum, and before I can process what's happening, my vision is consumed by white light. \n When the light fades, I'm no longer in the palace. \n I'm standing on a beach. Warm sand shifts beneath my feet, the sound of waves crashing against the shore filling my ears. The salty tang of the sea air is an impossible contrast to the cold, decaying atmosphere I'd just left. My heart races as I whirl around, trying to understand what just happened. The palace, the collapsing room, the mage—it's all gone, replaced by the endless horizon of ocean and sky. \n I clutch the gold bars tightly, my breath still ragged from the chaos, my mind racing with questions. How am I here? Why did the runes teleport me to this place? Was this a failsafe left by the mage, or some unseen force intervening? \n The only certainty is that I've escaped—for now. But this beach… it feels too peaceful, too perfect. And deep down, I Know it was all Real."
