 agot_tradition_volantene_name:0 "First Daughter of the Freehold"
 agot_tradition_volantene_desc:0 "Settled as the first colony of the Valyrian Freehold, the people of Volantis hold their Valyrian ancestry in the highest regard. Though not directly descended from the dragonlords of old, the Volantene aristocracy proudly claim to be their rightful heirs, embodying the sophistication, pride, and arrogance of their claimed ancestors. The rulers of Volantis present themselves as refined and cultured, but beneath this veil of nobility lies a deeply entrenched system of slavery. A system where lives are controlled with ruthless efficiency, fueling the city's wealth and status. For the Volantene elite, glory and order come first —even if it requires human suffering to achieve it."

This inclusivity is exemplified by their unwavering opposition to slavery, a stance that sharply contrasts with most other Free Cities. The fluid, graceful fighting style that combines precision and agility embodies the adaptability and resilience of Braavosi culture. To be a citizen of Braavos, is to be free and fight for that freedom."

 agot_tradition_north_valyrian_1_desc:0 "The Doom may have claimed Valyria in fire and ruin, but its echo persists in these cities—fading, twisted, and half-forgotten. Here, ancient traditions are followed without understanding, and legends of a glorious past haunt the shadows. This culture is the legacy of a lost empire, a tapestry woven from remnants of a power that once touched the sky but now lies in the dust, unable to either fully fade or return."

 agot_tradition_north_valyrian_2_desc:0 "The Freehold was never truly lost, only dormant, waiting for the ashes to cool and the embers to spark once more. Now, after centuries of slumber, the blood of old Valyria stirs, and the fire that once carved its legacy into stone and steel is rising. This rebirth is no shadowed echo but a resurgence of raw power and ambition, guided by ancient wisdom and tempered by the mistakes of a fractured past. Traditions once blindly followed are now renewed with purpose, while legends come alive—not as myths but as blueprints for a restored empire."
