zz_valyria_settlement.0020.desc:0 "It is time to begin the construction of your permanent settlement. But this is not a project that can be undertaken without careful preparation and slow and cautious construction. To help preserve your supplies and your labourers it is first necessary to prepare permanent dwellings that will facilitate the building process. You need to establish the priorities for how you are going about your work. And you must also determine the guiding philisophies for managing your rather expansive project."

zz_valyria_settlement.0020.b:0 "Through wealth and administration we will develop."
