######### SETTLEMENT CAMP SETUP ##############

zz_valyria_settlement.0020.t:0 "Lack of Progress"
zz_valyria_settlement.0020.desc:0 "The initial colonisation efforts provided a strong foundation from which to begin the construction of a permanent self-sufficient settlement. However, to your surprise, little progress has actually been made on restoring [host.GetCapitalLocation.GetTitle.GetBaseNameNoTierNoTooltip] since colonization ended. As you stride into the command tent, the overseer starts to brief you on the situation, trying his best to offer excuses for his failures.\n\n"

zz_valyria_settlement.0020.diesase.desc:0 "From his excuses, you gather that a significant portion of the colonists are sick and this is causing significant issues. Investigating further, you realise that the chief cause of this is a lack of hygiene, cramped conditions and insufficient infrastucture. Exacerbating the problem, new arrivals are now seeking to settle in the newly colonised province. It becomes clear that something must be done."

zz_valyria_settlement.0020.corruption.desc:0 "From his excuses, you gather that a significant portion of the colony's resources are being expended at a frenetic pace causing significant issues. Probing further, your overseer reveals that he suspects some of his men are embezzling supplies and are now even planning on plundering the supplies that you have brought with you. It is clear that something must be done to root out this rot."
