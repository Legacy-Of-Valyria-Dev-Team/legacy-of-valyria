You know the next moments are going to eat into your very soul, that you are going to like the stars of the heavens burn with an impossible light. But are you sure that such an action is truly safe?

The fire within becomes fire without, as your vision turns white with stars and a cosmic fire rips through and around you. The reagents of this encantation are consumed to so much dust, and the world has been touched by a star. But it has been done, the world has been changed, and the many threats of this land have given way before your power."

Shadows begin to form from the earth, taking shapes vaguely like men. They begin to take up the stones and move them into the configurations you have designed. Before your eyes a monumental construction is taking place, a castle, a city, a mighty temple, it is being formed now before you very eyes. As the shadows build your body tremples. A shaking trembling seeps forth into your very bones. But now is not yet the time to stumble. You must continue, your plan must itself keep going, and so you endure as the pain turns to a wracking agony. But even still, this power, this might, it is truly yours..."
