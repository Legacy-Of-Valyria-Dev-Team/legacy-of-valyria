  colonisation_magic_phase_core.0001.desc:0 "Your resources have been gathered, and you have prepared yourself for what is to come. You know the next moments are going to eat into your very soul, that you are going to like the stars of the heavens burn with an impossible light. But are you sure that such an action is truly safe? This is a question that you must put aside. You begin to chant, you begin to let the words flow from your flips, and you can feel your body begin to burn with inner fire. The fire within becomes fire without, as your vision turns white with stars and a cosmic fire rips through and around you. The reagents of this encantation are consumed to so much dust, and the world has been touched by a star. But it has been done, the world has been changed, and the many threats of this land have given way before your power."
