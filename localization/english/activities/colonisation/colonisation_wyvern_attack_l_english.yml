zz_valyria_colonisation.0601.desc:0 "As your colonists work to establish a foothold in the ruins of Valyria, a piercing screech echoes across the sky. A lone wyvern, its massive wings casting a shadow over the camp, swoops down, eyes gleaming with predatory intent. Panic grips the settlement as the beast circles overhead, preparing to strike.\n\nYou have precious moments to decide—do you rally your fighters, weapons in hand, and stand your ground against this fearsome creature? Or do you order an immediate evacuation, scattering your colonists to the safety of nearby caves and cover, abandoning supplies and risking the settlement’s progress? The wyvern’s wrath is imminent, and whatever you choose will shape the fate of your colony. Will you fight or flee?"

zz_valyria_colonisation.06011.desc:0 "As the wyvern gets closer and closer, you spot another winged creature behind it, one that dwarfs the wyvern in size. Initial shouts mistake it for another wyvern, raising the level of fear inside the camp to new heights. But you know better. That winged creature is one that you have ridden upon many times and share an unbreakable bond. [ROOT.Var('current_dragon').Char.GetFirstName] has come to your rescue.\n\nBefore the wyvern is aware of [ROOT.Var('current_dragon').Char.GetHerHis] presence, [ROOT.Var('current_dragon').Char.GetFirstName] ignites its wings with a large breath of fire. The wyvern screeches in agony and almost slams into the ruins of an ancient tower in a bid to escape the flames. [ROOT.Var('current_dragon').Char.GetFirstName] surges towards it and snakes [ROOT.Var('current_dragon').Char.GetHerHis] fanged maw around the wyvern's neck. Gore and viscera rain upon the camp. In the wyvern's dying moments however, it manages to struggle free, diving uncontrollably into the earth where it remains deathly still."

zz_valyria_colonisation.06012.t:0 "Wyvern slain by scorpions"
zz_valyria_colonisation.06012.desc:0 "As the wyvern glides closer and closer towards your camp, you hear the simulatenous click of a dozen scorpions loading. Designed for fighting dragons, a scorpion's heavy bolts should make short work of a wyvern - if they can hit. A volley of scorpion bolts surge towards the wyvern, but the agile beast dances around the bolts. Wave after wave of scorpion bolts fly into the sky but all of them miss - except one. You witness as a long scorpion bolt arcs towards the skull of the wyvern, digging itself into the creature's eye socket. The wyvern lets out a mighty roar before spinning from the sky.\n\nThat evening, the commander of your scorpions presents you with the man who fired the scorpion bolt. Will you take him into your service?"
