Outside, tents collapse; cries of alarm echo across the camp. The ground heaves, throwing dust and soil everywhere, as if the land itself rebels against you. You stagger outside, barking orders to direct relief efforts as the tremors subside. Gradually, order is restored, though the mood remains tense.\n\nLater that morning, you’re seated in your command tent, weary but resolute. Your steward, a seasoned man, arrives, his expression grave. He reports that the earthquakes are damaging supplies and weakening morale will likely continue—and intensify.\n\nYou listen, before rising and you addressing your steward and council..."

zz_valyria_colonisation.00401.desc:0 "The earth beneath [host.GetCurrentLocation.GetTitle.GetBaseNameNoTierNoTooltip] is restless, and it’s time to learn its temper. Hours are spent poring over ancient Valyrian scrolls. The texts describe how, in times past, Valyrians learned to “hear” the land—through signs in shifting rocks and changes in water flow.\n\nYou send scouts to track animals and measure tremors. Each report reveals subtle clues: changes in firewrym movements, shifting rivers, distant dawn rumbles. Patterns emerge, almost like the land’s heartbeat, and you realize they can foretell a quake.\n\nOne day, all signs align. You gather the colonists, advising them to brace. Moments later, the ground quakes—a brief but intense shake, with only minor damage and no injuries. From then on, your people look to you, their trust unwavering."

Soon, you gather enough clues—subtle shifts in water flow, strange movements of firewryms—to predict smaller tremors with reasonable accuracy. Though your predictions aren’t flawless, they’re enough to give people precious time to prepare, reducing injuries and preventing chaos in the camp.\n\nWhile some damage still occurs, people recognize the value of your vigilance, and their confidence in your leadership grows steadily."

You oversee the construction of a prototype, which is reinforced with arches and shock-absorbing materials.\n\nWhen the next tremor hits, the building holds strong, unscathed. News of the success spreads quickly, and soon all new structures are built to the same standard. Thanks to your innovation, the colony is safer, and its future more secure, able to withstand the unpredictable forces of Valyria."

You consult with your engineers and oversee the construction of a new prototype, reinforcing walls with a mix of dragonstone and flexible metals.\n\nWhen the next tremor strikes, the building holds up better than the previous ones—there’s no collapse, but some minor cracks appear in the walls. While not as resilient as you’d hoped, it’s a marked improvement. The designs are tweaked based on this feedback, and soon all new structures are built with these adjustments. Though not perfect, the colony is safer, and you’ve made significant progress toward securing its future in this unpredictable land."

Just a bit further, we can find steadier ground—someplace more secure.”\n\nThere’s hesitation in the crowd, a murmur of doubt, but after some discussion, a few key leaders agree. Slowly, others follow, though there are grumbles and concerns over the extra work.\n\nThe move is rougher than you’d hoped, with supplies running low and some colonists openly questioning the choice.

By midday, the rumbling ground sends cracks spidering through the camp, and debris begins to fall dangerously close to the remaining colonists. You watch in frustration as the disorganized evacuation leaves too many still at risk. By nightfall, only a handful of colonists have moved to safer areas, and the mood in camp has soured as fear and doubt set in.

It takes several hours of persistent encouragement, and by the time most agree, only a small group actually makes the journey with you to the safer ground.\n\nAs you and this group start setting up a rudimentary camp, a quake finally hits the old settlement.
