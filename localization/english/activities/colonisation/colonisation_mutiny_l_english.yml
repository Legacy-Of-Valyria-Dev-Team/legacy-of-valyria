zz_valyria_colonisation.0050.intro:0 "Your colonisation efforts in [host.GetCurrentLocation.GetTitle.GetBaseNameNoTierNoTooltip] have brought about many struggles for the people undertaking this project. The inhospitable landscape, frequent attacks by wild beasts, and the mutant sub-human wrecks have worn down morale.

zz_valyria_colonisation.00505.desc:0 "You gather your colonists, voices hushed in anticipation as you begin to speak, painting a vivid picture of the future—a land of prosperity, where those who labor now will reap rewards beyond measure.

Instead of bolstering morale, your attempt at inspiration seems to have underscored the current hardships, leaving the colony no more united than before, and perhaps even a bit more disillusioned."

[rebel_leader.GetHerHis|U] stance softens slightly, and you seize the opportunity to offer modest but tangible solutions, including clearer communication and a fairer distribution of resources. As the negotiations progress, [rebel_leader.GetFirstName] remains somewhat skeptical but begins to see the benefit of cooperating. Though he doesn’t agree to every point, he accepts enough compromises to assure you of [rebel_leader.GetHerHis|L] cooperation, and [rebel_leader.GetHerHis|L] followers gradually relent. The atmosphere within the camp improves, though there are still murmurs of discontent.

[rebel_leader.GetSheHe|U] agrees to halt any organized defiance, though with a clear warning that [rebel_leader.GetSheHe] and [rebel_leader.GetHerHis|L] followers will be watching your next moves closely.

You respond with reassurances and minor concessions, but each proposal seems to fall flat, dismissed with a hardened glare or outright skepticism.\n\nThe conversation grows tense, and it’s clear that [rebel_leader.GetFirstName] has little faith in your leadership or the promises made. [rebel_leader.GetSheHe|U] ends the meeting abruptly, rejecting any offers and warning that [rebel_leader.GetSheHe] won’t stand down until [rebel_leader.GetHerHis] demands are fully met. Back in camp, discontent spreads swiftly; murmurs of rebellion echo through the ranks, and morale falters. Despite your efforts, tensions are higher than ever, and a rift now divides the colony."
