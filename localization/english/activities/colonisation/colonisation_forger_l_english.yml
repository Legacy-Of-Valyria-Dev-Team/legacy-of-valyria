zz_valyria_colonisation.0300.desc:0 "Colonization of [location.GetBaronyNameExplicitly] has been progressing for some time, but today a young man arrived at camp. Producing documents, he claims to be the rightful heir to these ruins, asserting his ancestors ruled these lands before the Doom. Though his claims seem far-fetched and the documents’ authenticity cannot be verified, it is enough for him to assert rightful ownership. However, he offers to renounce his claim for gold. Your Master of Laws seeks your guidance on how to proceed."
zz_valyria_colonisation.0300.a:0 "I shall investigate these documents myself!"
zz_valyria_colonisation.0300.a.success.tt:0 "You discover that the documents are falsified"

zz_valyria_colonisation.03001.t:0 "A forgery after all"
zz_valyria_colonisation.03001.desc:0 "It doesn’t take long to uncover that the documents are clever forgeries. Several clues give it away: the ink and paper are far too modern, clearly produced after the Doom, and the calligraphy uses words that only came into use within the past century. With this knowledge, you can confidently dismiss the documents as fraudulent, but now the question remains—what to do with the forger? His skill could prove useful for clandestine tasks in your court, yet the law demands his execution."

zz_valyria_colonisation.03001.b.title:0 "I shall have him executed!"

zz_valyria_colonisation.03002.t:0 "Inconclusive findings"
zz_valyria_colonisation.03002.desc:0 "Despite your thorough efforts, the authenticity of the documents remains frustratingly inconclusive. To make matters worse, the claimant, clearly insulted by your questions and suspicions, has now increased his demand for compensation. He insists on even more gold in exchange for relinquishing his claim, declaring that the scrutiny has wasted his time and dishonored his noble lineage!"
zz_valyria_colonisation.03002.a.title:0 "Fine, you'll get your coin!"
zz_valyria_colonisation.03002.b.title:0 "You'll get nothing but steel, you fraud!"
