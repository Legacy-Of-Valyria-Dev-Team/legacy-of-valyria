zz_valyria_colonisation.05006.desc:0 "Night after night, you pore over ancient texts detailing firewyrm behavior, cross-referencing each line with recent attack reports from colonization teams. Gradually, a pattern emerges, leading you to a chilling revelation—the firewyrm lair lies deep beneath the ruins of an ancient Valyrian cathedral, concealed and undisturbed for centuries. The once-grand structure now looms as both a landmark and a warning, its cracked stone walls hinting at the creatures lurking below. With this knowledge in hand, you face a crucial decision: press forward into the depths and attempt to eradicate the threat, or fortify your colony and leave the lair undisturbed."

zz_valyria_colonisation.05001.desc:0 "After many cups of Dornish reds and fine Arbor gold, you and your guard captains finally complete the patrol schedules and rosters. As you review the paper map and the patrol plan, a sense of pride fills you; the interlocking and mutually reinforcing patrols will form a strong defense against any threat, whether magical or mundane. Throughout this planning session however, you have come to take note of the skills of Captain [captain.GetFirstName]. Although he is of common birth, he displays a grasp of military strategy that outstrips those whom have undergone a formal military education. Perhaps he is destined for a life above the common rank and file?"

zz_valyria_colonisation.05002.desc:0 "After countless cups of Dornish reds and Arbor gold, you and your guard captains finish drafting the patrol schedules. Yet, the attacks and injuries show no sign of slowing. A day passes, then another, until a full week has gone by. Reviewing the casualty reports, a chill creeps down your spine—your reorganization of the guard patrols has inadvertently left large areas unprotected. Tension in the camp has thickened, and fear grows as more colonists start to worry for their lives."
