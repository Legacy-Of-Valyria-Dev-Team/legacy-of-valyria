zz_valyria_colonisation.0200.coastal.desc:0 "As we press forward in our efforts to colonize [location.GetBaronyNameExplicitly], concerns over supply and logistics have grown urgent. One day, you are summoned to the quartermaster’s tent to discuss the situation. Spread before you are maps of trade routes and cargo manifests, but the mood is tense. Fewer ships are arriving than anticipated, and it’s becoming clear why.\n\nMerchants and captains are growing reluctant to sail across the Smoking Sea, fearful of its dangers—unpredictable weather, volcanic fumes, and the legends of creatures lurking beneath its surface. The lifeblood of the colony, everything from food to building materials, must be imported, and now those shipments are dwindling. Without reliable supply routes, the colony’s progress is at risk, and rationing may soon become a harsh necessity. There is much to be done, but so few resources to achieve it with."

zz_valyria_colonisation.02001.desc:0 "You assemble representatives from various merchant guilds in a grand tent beneath the towering ruins of [host.GetCurrentLocation.GetTitle.GetBaseNameNoTierNoTooltip].

As the last drops of strongwine and Dornish red are enjoyed, you seal a competitive trade deal, securing regular supply deliveries while keeping your colonization costs under control. The talks go so well that the leading merchant even presents you with a gift in celebration of the agreement!"

zz_valyria_colonisation.02002.desc:0 "You gather representatives from the merchant guilds in a grand tent beneath the looming ruins of [host.GetCurrentLocation.GetTitle.GetBaseNameNoTierNoTooltip]. After hours of bargaining, offering exclusive trade rights and moderate bonuses for reliable deliveries, you finally reach an agreement. The merchants agree to regular supply shipments, though at a slightly higher cost than anticipated.\n\nWhile the deal strains the budget a little, the guilds are satisfied, and supply lines are secured for the coming months. As the talks wrap up, one of the merchants raises a toast to the partnership, leaving you with a sense of relief that, though it may cost a bit more, the colony's needs are met for now."

zz_valyria_colonisation.02003.desc:0 "You manage to gather a few merchant representatives beneath the towering ruins of [host.GetCurrentLocation.GetTitle.GetBaseNameNoTierNoTooltip] in hopes of securing vital supply lines for the colony. After a lengthy discussion, the merchants finally agree to deliver shipments, but at a considerable markup and with limited regularity.\n\nThe agreement is far from ideal, straining your resources and leaving you uncertain about future deliveries. Still, it’s a start—enough to keep the colony afloat, even if supply is tighter and costlier than expected. As the merchants depart, you know you’ll need to find ways to stretch every shipment and make every coin count."

After hours of intense negotiations, you offer them exclusive trade monopolies and attractive bonuses for timely deliveries. However, it becomes clear too late that the merchants have been colluding to inflate prices. As a result, you're forced to make an additional upfront payment to get shipments started, increasing the cost of your supplies."
