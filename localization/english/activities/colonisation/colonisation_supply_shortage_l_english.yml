zz_valyria_colonisation.0200.coastal.desc:0 "As we press forward in our efforts to colonize [location.GetBaronyNameExplicitly], concerns over supply and logistics have grown urgent. One day, you are summoned to the quartermaster’s tent to discuss the situation. Spread before you are maps of trade routes and cargo manifests, but the mood is tense. Fewer ships are arriving than anticipated, and it’s becoming clear why.\n\nMerchants and captains are growing reluctant to sail across the Smoking Sea, fearful of its dangers—unpredictable weather, volcanic fumes, and the legends of creatures lurking beneath its surface. The lifeblood of the colony, everything from food to building materials, must be imported, and now those shipments are dwindling. Without reliable supply routes, the colony’s progress is at risk, and rationing may soon become a harsh necessity. There is much to be done, but so few resources to achieve it with."

zz_valyria_colonisation.02001.desc:0 "You assemble representatives from various merchant guilds in a grand tent beneath the towering ruins of [host.GetCurrentLocation.GetTitle.GetBaseNameNoTierNoTooltip]. Hours of intense negotiations follow, where you offer exclusive trade monopolies and lucrative bonuses for timely, consistent shipments. As the last drops of strongwine and Dornish red are enjoyed, you seal a competitive trade deal, securing regular supply deliveries while keeping your colonization costs under control. The talks go so well that the leading merchant even presents you with a gift in celebration of the agreement!"

As a result, you're forced to make an additional upfront payment to get shipments started, increasing the cost of your supplies."
