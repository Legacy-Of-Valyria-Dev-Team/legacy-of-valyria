zz_valyria_colonisation.0200.coastal.desc:0 "As we press forward in our efforts to colonize [location.GetBaronyNameExplicitly], concerns over supply and logistics have grown urgent. One day, you are summoned to the quartermaster’s tent to discuss the situation. Spread before you are maps of trade routes and cargo manifests, but the mood is tense. Fewer ships are arriving than anticipated, and it’s becoming clear why.\n\nMerchants and captains are growing reluctant to sail across the Smoking Sea, fearful of its dangers—unpredictable weather, volcanic fumes, and the legends of creatures lurking beneath its surface. The lifeblood of the colony, everything from food to building materials, must be imported, and now those shipments are dwindling. Without reliable supply routes, the colony’s progress is at risk, and rationing may soon become a harsh necessity. There is much to be done, but so few resources to achieve it with."

zz_valyria_colonisation.02001.desc:0 "You assemble representatives from various merchant guilds in a grand tent beneath the towering ruins of [host.GetCurrentLocation.GetTitle.GetBaseNameNoTierNoTooltip]. Hours of intense negotiations follow, where you offer exclusive trade monopolies and lucrative bonuses for timely, consistent shipments. As the last drops of strongwine and Dornish red are enjoyed, you seal a competitive trade deal, securing regular supply deliveries while keeping your colonization costs under control. The talks go so well that the leading merchant even presents you with a gift in celebration of the agreement!"

zz_valyria_colonisation.02002.desc:0 "You gather representatives from the merchant guilds in a grand tent beneath the looming ruins of [host.GetCurrentLocation.GetTitle.GetBaseNameNoTierNoTooltip]. After hours of bargaining, offering exclusive trade rights and moderate bonuses for reliable deliveries, you finally reach an agreement. The merchants agree to regular supply shipments, though at a slightly higher cost than anticipated.\n\nWhile the deal strains the budget a little, the guilds are satisfied, and supply lines are secured for the coming months. As the talks wrap up, one of the merchants raises a toast to the partnership, leaving you with a sense of relief that, though it may cost a bit more, the colony's needs are met for now."

zz_valyria_colonisation.02003.desc:0 "You manage to gather a few merchant representatives beneath the towering ruins of [host.GetCurrentLocation.GetTitle.GetBaseNameNoTierNoTooltip] in hopes of securing vital supply lines for the colony. After a lengthy discussion, the merchants finally agree to deliver shipments, but at a considerable markup and with limited regularity.\n\nThe agreement is far from ideal, straining your resources and leaving you uncertain about future deliveries. Still, it’s a start—enough to keep the colony afloat, even if supply is tighter and costlier than expected. As the merchants depart, you know you’ll need to find ways to stretch every shipment and make every coin count."

After hours of intense negotiations, you offer them exclusive trade monopolies and attractive bonuses for timely deliveries. However, it becomes clear too late that the merchants have been colluding to inflate prices. As a result, you're forced to make an additional upfront payment to get shipments started, increasing the cost of your supplies."

zz_valyria_colonisation.02005.t:0 "Succesful Rationing"
zz_valyria_colonisation.02005.desc:0 "With supply lines strained and shipments delayed, you call your advisors together to implement a bold rationing program, aiming to stretch current provisions twice as long as projected. Carefully planning fair but strict distributions, you adjust rations based on each colonist's role and lead by example, addressing the colony in the main square to explain the need for sacrifice.\n\nYour calm confidence wins over even the skeptics. Colonists accept the plan enthusiastically, with many organizing shared meals to stretch portions further. Remarkably, health and morale stay high, and soon, the colony's situation is not only stable but thriving—unified by resilience and shared purpose."

zz_valyria_colonisation.02006.desc:0 "With supply lines strained and shipments delayed, you call your advisors together to establish a rationing program, hoping to make provisions last. After careful planning, you organize fair distributions, adjusting rations based on each colonist's duties and ensuring everyone understands the program's importance.\n\nMost colonists accept the plan, though some grumble at the reduced portions. Despite this, the colony adjusts, and resourceful colonists begin pooling supplies, keeping spirits relatively steady. The rationing isn't easy, but it holds."

zz_valyria_colonisation.02008.desc:0 "Facing a serious supply shortage, you hastily organize a rationing plan, cutting portions to ensure everyone can last. After a brief meeting, the new distribution rules are set, though not everyone is happy with the drastic reduction.\n\nWithin days, tensions flare. Some colonists hoard rations, others trade desperately, and resentment simmers over perceived inequalities. Grumblings turn to open complaints, and before long, groups of colonists disregard the rationing entirely, dipping into what little remains. Soon, morale has fractured, and your authority over the colony feels strained, casting a shadow on future decisions."

zz_valyria_colonisation.02009.desc:0 "By candlelight in your tent, you finalize a covert plan with trusted intermediaries: hire privateers to raid merchant ships, capturing valuable supplies without exposing your hand. Soon, reports arrive confirming the plan’s resounding success. The privateers have struck swiftly, seizing grain, meats, cloth, and oil essential for the colony, while fear and confusion about “pirate” attacks ripple through the ports.\n\nThe colony flourishes, with warehouses stocked well beyond expectation. As you lift a goblet, a trophy from the flagship of a raided vessel, you savor the quiet victory: the colony’s future is secure, and your involvement remains hidden."

zz_valyria_colonisation.02010.t:0 "Successful Raiding"
zz_valyria_colonisation.02010.desc:0 "In the secrecy of your tent, you arrange a deal with intermediaries to hire privateers for a mission: intercept merchant ships carrying essential supplies without linking the raids back to the colony. Weeks pass, and although the raids have had mixed results, a few critical vessels are successfully intercepted, securing shipments of grain, salted meat, and some much-needed timber.\n\nWhile not every ship yields supplies, the bounty brought back proves enough to ease the pressure on resources and uplift morale. Your colony breathes easier with the extra provisions, and rumors in the ports cast the blame far and wide, keeping suspicions away from your own dealings. The plan has succeeded, providing the lifeline your settlement needed without betraying its source."

zz_valyria_colonisation.02011.desc:0 "In the dim light of your tent, you finalize arrangements with intermediaries to hire a fleet of privateers for a discreet raid on merchant ships. After weeks of waiting, reports trickle in: a few ships were successfully intercepted, though they carried only modest supplies. The privateers managed to return with some crates of grain, dried fruits, and a small stock of oil—useful, yet far from abundant.\n\nWhile the bounty doesn’t fully meet the colony’s needs, it provides just enough to cover immediate shortages and buy you time to seek other supply sources. The plan has brought a modest but valuable gain, and the colony’s resourcefulness keeps suspicion from falling on you."

zz_valyria_colonisation.02012.desc:0 "In the flickering lamplight of your tent, you finalize plans with intermediaries to hire privateers to raid supply ships, hoping for a windfall of provisions for the colony. But days pass with no word, then weeks, until finally, news arrives—though not the kind you expected. The raids have failed miserably, with few supplies captured and several ships wrecked in the attempt. Worse still, one captured privateer, eager to save his own skin, has revealed your involvement under interrogation.\n\nThe fallout is swift and brutal. Traders in nearby ports cut off all routes to your colony, merchants brand you a threat, and word spreads that your colony cannot be trusted. Supplies dwindle quickly, and your people whisper of betrayal, their trust shaken. The gambit has collapsed completely, leaving the colony isolated, your authority damaged, and your reputation as fragile as the crumbling ruins around you."
