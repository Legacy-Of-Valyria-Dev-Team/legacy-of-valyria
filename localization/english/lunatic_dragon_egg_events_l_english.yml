However his son, King Viserys I, would not proove to be so wise, facing a similar sucession crisis, Viserys, instead of convening a great council, decides to name his eldest daughter Rhaenyra his heir, this would prove to be a fatal mistake as the Hightower-Targaryen Branch of the Family led by Queen Alicent & her son Aegon II attempt to usurp the Iron Throne which will be faced with rath and dragonblood by Rhaenyra and would end up causing the near-extinction of The House of the Dragon."

King Robert Baratheon is dead, and the Iron Throne is claimed by his young son Joffrey, though whispers of his illegitimacy sow discord across the realm. In the Riverlands, Robb Stark is declared King in the North, seeking vengeance for his father’s execution and the independence of his people. To the south, Stannis and Renly Baratheon wage their own war for the crown, each claiming legitimacy over Joffrey’s rule. In the Iron Islands, Balon Greyjoy rises to declare himself king, exploiting the realm’s turmoil to raid and pillage. As the storm of war rages across Westeros, the Night’s Watch faces its own existential threat beyond the Wall, where an ancient and deadly force awakens."
