 zz_valyria_centuryofblood_desc:0 "The Valyrian Freehold has fallen, collapsing when the peninsula was destroyed in the Doom. Within mere hours, Valyria was gone and the Freehold was destroyed. House Targaryen had relocated to Dragonstone, the westernmost outpost of Valyria located in the narrow sea, thereby ensuring their survival.\n\nSome other dragonlords — those who had not been in Valyria when the Doom occurred — survived as well. In Tyrosh, Lys and Qohor, it is said that dragonlords were spared the destruction and were now unsure of what their futures held. #bold \n\nAurion Varezys, a dragonlord who had been visiting Qohor, proclaimed himself the first Emperor of Valyria and raised forces from the Qohorik. With his dragon and an army of thirty thousand men he marches to claim Valyria's remains...#!"

In response to this, Aenar sold his holdings in the Valyrian Freehold and the Lands of the Long Summer, and moved with his family and dragons to Dragonstone, the westernmost outpost of the Valyrian Freehold. The Targaryens were far from the most powerful of the dragonlords, and their rivals in Valyria saw their flight as an act of cowardice. However, because Aenar had moved his family away from Valyria, the Targaryens were the strongest of the dragonlords to survive the Doom"

Both brothers have ambitions to take their father's military power and claim the Kingdom of the Trident from the Durrandons with the only question being whether they can work together for this aim, or if one will try to claim power over the other."

Since my ancestor [arlan.GetFirstNameRegnal] united the two empires as one and destroyed the pretender king [lucifer.GetFirstName], the line of [benedict.GetFirstNameRegnal] has been extinguished. House Durrandon remains as the only Kings of the Trident and Stormlands.\n\nAll is not as it appears. Contention within the realm grows... From the West there are rumblings that the Ironborn under [qhorwyn.GetFirstNameRegnal] are stirring with possible ambitions of conquering the wealth of the Trident. There is also whispers of a surviving member of House Justman spreading word that they are the rightful ruler of the Trident... Another Justman who desires to be released from this mortal coil to ensure the stag continues to rule over the Rivers and Storms."

If I had not have acted when I did, selling all of our family's wealth and moving to this dreary volcanic outpost, our family would surely have been destroyed. The Freehold went from the most powerful force in the world, to a shadow of a nothingness in a matter of hours. House Targaryen could very well be the most powerful family left.\n\nI must ponder what the future holds for myself and my family. Do we build up our lands and maintain the will of the Freehold in this singular outpost, or do we expand the Freehold's influence once more upon the Free Cities and, perhaps, Westeros itself?"
