The Targaryens were far from the most powerful of the dragonlords, and their rivals in Valyria saw their flight as an act of cowardice.

House Durrandon remains as the only Kings of the Trident and Stormlands.\n\nAll is not as it appears. Contention within the realm grows... From the West there are rumblings that the Ironborn under [qhorwyn.GetFirstNameRegnal] are stirring with possible ambitions of conquering the wealth of the Trident. There is also whispers of a surviving member of House Justman spreading word that they are the rightful ruler of the Trident...

Those who bowed were spared and those who resisted were snuffed from the world or driven into exile with their former kingdoms left to rot the same as this one.\n\nAs I let those stories flow into my mind I can't help but wonder if the Freehold became weak as time went on, I wonder if those conquerors, those heroes from the stories would look at my brethren and feel shame for what we became. Valyria was once the pinnacle of the world, but at the end it felt as if we were nothing more but bickering children fighting over power and wealth... perhaps that is why the Gods chose to doom our people... perhaps I have been chosen to keep the dream of Valyria alive."
