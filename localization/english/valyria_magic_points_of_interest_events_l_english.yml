zz_valyria_the_doom.0001.01.desc:0 "Under the shadow of the mighty volcanoic spire of [doom_location.GetTitle.GetBaseNameNoTierNoTooltip] you have stumbled upon a cracked and shattered formation of black and oily stone. When you reach out your hand to touch it, your mind is expanded, opened, to the very horrors of the universe. You see with an unfolding clarity an ever-expanding horizon, and you heart within your heart, within your very essence a voice of a thousand voices speaking directly to you. You see flashes of fire, and rivers of blood, of murky tentacled horror that reaches forth from the deepest and most tortured abyss. Your mind begins to question, and your heart begins to quake. Is this the way the doom unfolded? Was this something that contributed ot the fall of Old Valyria?" 
zz_valyria_the_doom.0001.02.desc:0 "You have begun to explore the lands of [doom_location.GetTitle.GetBaseNameNoTierNoTooltip]. The marks of the unfathomable disaster have been carved into the landscape, remaking the very core of the world. You see gouges in stone, and formations of obsidian and basalt that hint towards some kind of settlement and preparation on the slopes of the Volcano. What where they doing here? What was their endeavour? The air is stilted, and life itself seems drawn into strange stones, that sit in the centre of formations of a black stone that leaks a kind of oily presence that you can feel and sense, not with touch or other physical senses, but inside your very soul. You know that something unfathomably wrong happened here. Some great action was undertaken, but its consequences... Perhaps in these locations can be found the secrets that unfolded to doom the greatest empire of the world."
zz_valyria_the_doom.0001.03.desc:0 "[doom_location.GetTitle.GetBaseNameNoTierNoTooltip] is a shattered wreck, a ruined twisting sore on the face of reality. You can taste it on your tongue, and as you close your eyes an unfathomable entity reaches into your dreams, its many mouthed tentacles worse than the ravings of the sailors who swear they have seen the Deep Ones, or even the Drowned Priests and their visions of the Drowned God. It is in these moments that the legends out of Asshai, or the ghoulish tendencies of the priests of Qohor and their Black Goat seem positively tame. And yet, the reality of where you are eludes your senses, you cannot quite name that which is wrong, you cannot quite say that which has changed. Only you know that here and now something in the world is not right. Something is and can only be called wrong. You feel a pulling, a tension on your mind's very grasp of the now, and as you fall away you see, with horror and with stumbling realisation you simply see, the great horror beyond the stary scaffolds of the cosmos, the realities beyond the ken of man..."
zz_valyria_the_doom.0001.04.desc:0 "Your travels in the blasted lands of the former great empire have brought you to this unholy place, the ruins of [doom_location.GetTitle.GetBaseNameNoTierNoTooltip]. It is odd, but the first thing you notice is the lack of any sound. It is as if no life can bare to be within the vision of the volanco. You also see, that there are those strange stones, purest black, with a leaking, almost oily substance seeping from the pores of the stone. You are struck immediately by the reality that there is something entirely missing from the world in this place. Something has been forever removed, ripped away at the most basic foundational and conceptual level of reality. And you feel like you are being watched. Like your soul is being pierced by a vision from beyond the borders of the natural. You are being watched and dissected from the timeless realm of the cosmic heavens. Taken apart, diagnosed, possessed and dispossed. A whisper begins to creep onto the edge of your inner voice, speaking with words not your own within your own internal deliberations. What unfathomable entity have you drawn the gaze of? And what does it have to do with this horror that has remade the very essence of the land. [doom_location.GetTitle.GetBaseNameNoTierNoTooltip] has been forever changed by what happened, and you have the crippling growing sensation, that you, you are soon to be similarly changed, and perhaps just as terribly.."
zz_valyria_the_doom.0001.05.desc:0 "In the dark night, with crackling flame, you hear a whisper just beyond your hearing. You arrived in [doom_location.GetTitle.GetBaseNameNoTierNoTooltip] in the dusk hours and were taken by the blasted scars in the slopes of the volcano. Setting up a camp to take rest from your travels, you let the shadows begin to creep with only a simple fire to keep at bay the darkness. But now, these forboding whsipers have begun to infect your slumbering mind. Are they the products of your mind's letting go of its faculties as you turn to slumber. Or are they really whispers of something infesting the remains of this land. You see the ominious shadows cast by obilisks of seeping black stone. You see the petrified remnants of a dragon, consumed in ash and flame and brought low, only for its bones to be left on display as the elements wore away its entrapping cocoon of death. This is a most accursed land. You wish to start, to begin your endeavours to leave this cursed land. To free yourself from the horrors that have begun to torment you. But you know you cannot do so yet. You hear your horses and pack animals start, but you cannot determine why. You let your eyes close ever slightly, letting your mind drift away from this horror world, and then you see... You see the gaping maw, the writhing tentacles, the groping, gesticulations of consumption... It is coming for you, it wishes to take you, mind body and soul!... You start, you are awake, and yet the shaodws seem ever more alive..."
zz_valyria_the_doom.0001.06.desc:0 "Black scars litter the landscape of [doom_location.GetTitle.GetBaseNameNoTierNoTooltip]. Where once there was a mighty tower on the slopes of the mountain of fire, now only the broken remains of settlement endure.  At first you simply notice an unsettling silence, as if all life was sucked beyond this place. Not even the corrupted wild life of this broken land seem to be willing to dwell in the shade of the mountain. This begs an unsettling question. What took place here? Was what happened truly that far beyond the scope of mortal imagination? You seek to settle in for the day's rest and notice that the mountain is ringed in formations of oily black stone. Your interest piqued, you move to more closely inspect the formations. With a start you realise that these fragments of stone carry within them a power that exists within the purely conceptual world. These are markers, bindings, that brind forth the imaginary to the real. Some kind of magic was done here. Some mystery that brought forth into actualisation a concept beyond the rational, beyond the proper boundaries of mortal men. You settle in to sleep, but your mind is troubled by this discovery. And as your eyes close, you feel the gaze of an intelligence infinitely greater than your own settle upon you..."

zz_valyria_the_doom.002.t:0 "The Red Comet Comes"
zz_valyria_the_doom.002.desc:0 "As the dreams had in the shadow of the wrecks of Valyria fester in your mind, you have begun to see. You are not sure in which world this might be real, but you know in at least one, the beast that has haunted your visions sought to make Valyria it's instrument of power. You have seen the unfolding of rituals, of rivers of blood shed to bind forth unrealities into the real. The stone that weeps its black haze, that haze became a thick surrounding consuming fog, and life couldn't endure its arrival. But is this true? How could this have brought the end of this once mighty empire. Surely this is just a delusion of a weakened mind. In other visions, you see the fires of the mountains begin to roar, as entities beyond the scale of man strove against each other in the conceptual space that binds the cosmos. The fire and the ice sought to consume each other, and instead the world had to carry their scars. Where in one place a wall of ice rising beyond the tallest castle wall buffetted the exchange, in another place, the mountains of fire unleahsed a flame that burned concepts themselves into nothing. And in another reality still, the God of your nightmares, with its many grasping maws was sought in the name of a vaunted immortality. But alas all it brought was a magic unfathomable, as fire became the means of consumption. You cannot know which of these visions, or indeed the many multitude of other visions you have had fleeting sight off were the true reality. But this you can know. That the doom of the Valyria involved the struggles of the uncaring Star Gods, and having seen them, you cannot unsee, having seen them you have beome something... else, something altered in your basic conceptual nature..."
