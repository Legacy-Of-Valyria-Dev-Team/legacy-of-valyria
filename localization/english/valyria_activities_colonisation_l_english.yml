Panic grips the settlement as the beast circles overhead, preparing to strike.\n\nYou have precious moments to decide—do you rally your fighters, weapons in hand, and stand your ground against this fearsome creature? Or do you order an immediate evacuation, scattering your colonists to the safety of nearby caves and cover, abandoning supplies and risking the settlement’s progress? The wyvern’s wrath is imminent, and whatever you choose will shape the fate of your colony. Will you fight or flee?"
