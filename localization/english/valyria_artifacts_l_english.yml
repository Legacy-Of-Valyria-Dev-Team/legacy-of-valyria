book_dragonlore_desc:0 "A heavy, timeworn tome on dragonlore, dragon breeding, and dragontaming, produced before the Doom of Valyria. The hardback cover is made of Valyrian steel, its dark, shimmering surface etched with intricate dragon motifs. Despite the steel’s durability, the pages inside show signs of age—yellowed and brittle, with some edges fraying. The once-vibrant ink has faded, but the secrets of mastering dragons remain legible, preserved by the enduring strength of its enchanted binding. This book is a rare relic, its contents as dangerous and powerful as the creatures it describes."
