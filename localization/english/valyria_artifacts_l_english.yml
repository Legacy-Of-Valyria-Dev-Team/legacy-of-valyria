book_dragonlore_desc:0 "A heavy, timeworn tome on dragonlore, dragon breeding, and dragontaming, produced before the Doom of Valyria. The hardback cover is made of Valyrian steel, its dark, shimmering surface etched with intricate dragon motifs. Despite the steel’s durability, the pages inside show signs of age—yellowed and brittle, with some edges fraying. The once-vibrant ink has faded, but the secrets of mastering dragons remain legible, preserved by the enduring strength of its enchanted binding. This book is a rare relic, its contents as dangerous and powerful as the creatures it describes."

book_life_desc:0 "This aged tome, dedicated to the study of life, health, fertility, and medicine, was crafted in Valyria long before its Doom. Though the leather-bound cover is cracked and weathered, the pages inside hold the most advanced knowledge known to the world. Detailed diagrams, precise formulas, and groundbreaking theories on healing, childbirth, and longevity fill its fragile, yellowed pages. Despite its worn appearance, this book remains a treasure trove of wisdom—its insights unmatched by anything produced in modern times. The faded ink may suggest age, but the knowledge it contains is timeless, a testament to the unparalleled intellect of Valyria's healers."
